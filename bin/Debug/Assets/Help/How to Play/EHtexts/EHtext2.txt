Based on the limits, the player to the left of the dealer's button (the small blind) and the player two to the left of the button (the big blind) are required to put up mandatory bets before the cards are dealt. 
These blinds count toward your total investment toward the first round of betting.
 So if the pot isn't raised preflop, the small blind will only have to put in another half a bet to call. 
 Likewise, the big blind won't have to put anything more in the pot, although the big will have the ability to raise his own blind. 
 In an unraised preflop pot, this is referred to as having the option.
