*Pre-Flop
Betting begins with the player seated to the immediate left of the big blind. 
If you are this player you can call the blind bet by pressing "Call" (hotkey C) or fold by pressing "Fold" (hotkey F), in which case you surrender your cards.
If you like your hand, however, you can also raise.
When the action gets around to the little blind, he, too, must call, fold, or raise. 
In any case, he has already paid a fraction of a bet, so it is cheaper for him to call than for the other players. 
If he folds, he forfeits his blind and his money stay's on the table.
The big blind is last to act before the flop. 
He is got the same options as the players before him, with one difference: because he is already put in a full bet, he can simply check, indicating he is taking no further action, if no one has raised and he himself doesn not want to raise.
TIP *Folding while on big blind is not recommended.

* On the Flop
After the three common cards of the flop are dealt, betting starts again.
Because in this round no one has bet yet, the first player has the option of checking, meaning she takes no action or betting.
The betting action keeps moving to the left. If the first player checked, the next player has the same options of either checking or betting. 
But if the first player bet, the next player must now either call that bet, fold, or raise.
The action continues around the table, until either everyone has checked, or someone has opened the betting and gotten at least one caller (or possibly a raiser). 
If everyone checks, then everyone remains in and gets to see the turn card. 
But if someone bets, only those players who call that bet (or raise it) get to see the turn card.
 Otherwise they must fold. If no one calls, the bettor wins the pot automatically.
 
 * On the Turn and River
Betting on the turn and the river is just like betting on the flop. 
On the river, if more than one player is left in the hand after the betting is over, the players flip over their hands. 
This is called the showdown. The pot will be given to to the winner, or if there’s a tie, splited accordingly. 
The cards will be shuffled, and it starts all over again.
