To start with, each player is dealt two cards face down. 
These cards are known as hole cards, and in Hold em, they are the only cards that are yours alone.A round of betting follows.
Next, the computer deals three cards face up in the center of the table. This is called "/the flop/".
These three cards are community cards, meaning everyone can use them. There is another round of betting.
The computer now deals a fourth face-up card, called "the turn".
Again, it is a shared card that all players can use, and again, it is followed by a round of betting.
A fifth and final card is dealt face-up, called "the river". There is one last round of betting.
If more than one player is left in the hand, there is a showdown: the players flip over their hole cards to see who has the best hand. 
The five cards in the middle are collectively called the board. 
Each player gets to combine one, both, or none of his hole cards with any of the cards from the board to create his best five-card poker hand.
